## 🎯 Tasks I will be involved in 🎯

- **Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection** 🕵️‍♂️
  
  In this task, I'll develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance, training classification algorithms, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Task 7: Shopper Sentiments** 🛍️
  
  Task 7 involves analyzing the ShopperSentiments dataset, which contains over 250,000 customer reviews on TeePublic. Using this data, I'll explore sentiment analysis, geospatial patterns, temporal trends, and review categorization to gain insights into customer preferences in online fashion retail.

- **Task 8: Fake News Prediction** 📰
  
  In Task 8, I'll work with the Fake News Prediction Dataset to build predictive models capable of identifying fake news articles. By analyzing features such as title and text, I aim to contribute to efforts in combating misinformation and promoting media literacy.
